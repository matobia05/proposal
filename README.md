# iOS Project Proposal
iOS Track Project Proposal
## What type of project is this?

I will be working on a mobile application called **"Study Buddy"** that will 
specifically target iOS users. This iOS app is designed to help college students 
connect with study partners in their classes and field of study. By using filters 
such as subjects, classes, availability, and study preferences, the app will allow 
students to find compatible partners with similar schedules and goals. Through 
"Study Buddy," users can create profiles indicating their preferred study styles, 
times, and subjects of interest, making it easy to form effective study teams.

Additionally, the app will include a built-in messaging feature, allowing students 
to communicate and plan study sessions directly within the app. To enhance its 
functionality, “Study Buddy” will also include a scheduling feature, allowing 
users to set up and confirm study sessions, as well as reminders to stay organized. 
Users will be able to rate their study sessions, providing feedback that could help 
others in the future. With a focus on college-specific needs, the app will also 
allow users to join group study sessions and create small study communities for 
particular courses. This app’s overall goal is to foster academic collaboration 
in a way that fits the fast-paced schedules and unique needs of college students.

## Why did you choose to work on this project?

I chose to work on "Study Buddy" because I know firsthand how challenging it can 
be to find effective study partners who match one's schedule, study goals, and 
focus level. The motivation for this project stems from my interest in developing 
practical tools for the everyday lives of students, especially as a computer 
science student who values collaborative learning. A study app like this one could 
have a positive impact on student performance and retention, encouraging students 
to stay engaged and motivated by connecting with peers. 

By developing "Study Buddy," I’m excited to gain experience in solving real-world 
problems through mobile technology while helping students improve their academic 
experience through convenient and effective peer-to-peer learning.

## Who is the target audience of this app?

The target audience for "Study Buddy" primarily includes college students aged 
18 to 24 who are currently enrolled in higher education programs. These students 
may be in various fields of study, such as computer science, engineering, business, 
or liberal arts, and they all share the need for effective academic collaboration. 
Most of the target users will be undergraduates, but the app could also appeal to 
graduate students in similar age ranges who may also benefit from study partnerships. 
The app will be particularly beneficial for students who are more comfortable using 
digital resources for learning and communication, which includes a significant 
percentage of today’s college students.

As the app is designed for iOS, it will target users who own Apple devices, such as 
**iPhones**, **iPads**, and possibly **Apple Watches** for reminder notifications. 
Many students rely on their mobile devices for managing their schedules and social 
interactions, so designing this app for iOS maximizes its accessibility and relevance. 
While computers might be used by students to access supplementary materials, 
"Study Buddy" is intended to be a mobile solution. By focusing on iOS, I can ensure 
the app is streamlined, portable, and easily integrated into students' daily routines.

## What problem does your project hope to tackle?

The problem that the Study Buddy App hopes to tackle is the **difficulty students 
face in finding suitable study partners**. Often, students struggle to connect with 
classmates who are available at the same time or have similar study habits. This 
can lead to isolated study experiences or inefficient study sessions, which can 
ultimately affect academic performance. Many students also don’t know where to find 
peers with whom they can collaborate outside of class hours, and they may not have 
the right tools to identify study partners who match their specific needs.

The app will help solve this problem by providing a **centralized platform** where 
students can create profiles and list their courses, study preferences, and schedules. 
This will allow them to quickly find study partners who are taking the same classes 
or have compatible study habits. By incorporating **scheduling features**, the app 
will also ensure that students can find study buddies who are available at the same 
time, reducing the likelihood of scheduling conflicts. The in-app messaging system 
will provide a seamless way for students to communicate, share study materials, and 
coordinate their study sessions.

The target audience, college students, will benefit greatly from this app as it will 
**increase their access to peer support**, helping them to form study groups, enhance 
their learning experience, and stay on top of their coursework. By collaborating with 
others, students can gain new perspectives, clarify doubts, and stay motivated to 
achieve their academic goals. Furthermore, the app’s features will help students 
manage their time more efficiently, promoting a balanced and productive approach to 
their studies. Ultimately, this will improve both their academic outcomes and overall 
college experience.
